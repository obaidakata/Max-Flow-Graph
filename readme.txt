Algorithms final project:

The purpase of the project is to find the max-flow of a given graph using Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm that can be implemented
in 2 ways.
The first option is an algorithm that based on BFS.
The second option is a greddy algorithm that uses a virsen of Dijkstra algorithm.

For example:





The output will be:

BFS Method:
Max flow = 23 Mincut:S=1,2,3,5. T=4,6 Number of iterations = 3
Greedy Method:
Max flow = 23 MinCut:S=1,2,3,5. T=4,6 Number of iterations = 4
